        <h3>COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates<br></h3>
       <h4> From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather.<br>
         Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to <br>
         protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on <br>
         your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.<br></h4>
         <h3> Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus. </h3>
        <h4>There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body<br>
          temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way <br>
          to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or<br>
           washing them with soap and water.</h4>
           <h3>Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?
            </h3>
         <h4>  People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical<br>
             conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. <br>
             WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene<br>
             and good respiratory hygiene.</h4>
